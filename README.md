# Market Project

*Intro:*   
I was making this project in June but then Epam school had started so the project is quite raw for now.

What is ready: 

ADMIN role:  
You can add new categories and items;   
Let you change existing categories and items;   
Finally, you have access to Items in JSON format.

USER/ADMIN role:  
Bootstrap/NavBar;   
Login/Registration page;  
Items page and searching by names/categories.

| GOTO | Link  | Short description
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screenshots | [img](src/main/resources/screenshots) | Here you can see how it looks like when db is not empty. |

Next TODO:   
DB migration;   
Add/delete items to shopping cart;   
Make orders from shopping cart.
